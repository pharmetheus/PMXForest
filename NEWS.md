# PMXForest 1.2.10

* Making sure that IDs with missing data are only filtered out for the missing covariate concerned instead of across all covariates

# PMXForest 1.2.9

* Repeating the 1.2.8 release since something went wrong in the packaging.

# PMXForest 1.2.8

* Clarified documentations in some functions.
* Added an `xlim` argument to `forestPlot`.
* Changed the rounding function in `getCovStats`from `round` to `signif`.
* Clarified the documentation for `getCovStats()` so it is clear it requires a data.frame and not a file.
* Moved getForestDFFREM to PMXFrem
* Added argument parameterLabelsPrefix that will prepend parameterLabelsPrefix to the facet labels for the parameter panels.

# PMXForest 1.2.7

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# PMXForest 1.2.6

* Fixed a bug related to the order of facet panels and facet labels when the user
  provides `parameters` to `forestPlot` that has a different order than `functionListName`.
* `statisticsLabels`should now be a string instead of a vector (see blow).

There is a potentially serious bug in PMXForest in versions prior to and including 1.2.4. It occurs when the user requests certain parameters using the parameters argument to the forestPlot function and when the order of the requested parameters is different from the order the parameters have in the return statement from the paramFunction. In this case there will be a missmatch between the order of the panels in the forest plot and the facet labels.:

    paramFunction <- function(thetas, df,…} {
    …
    return(c(CL,Frel,AUC))
    }
    
    functionListName <- c("CL","Frel","AUC")
    
    forestPlot(dfres,parameters=c(“Frel”,”CL”))

In this hypothetical example, the facet order will be Frel and CL but the face labels will have the same order as in `functionListName`, i.e. CL, Frel.

This has been fixed in PMXForest 1.2.6. Note that this fix necessitated a change to the `statisticsLabels` argument to the `forestPlot` function. Previously `statisticsLabels` expected a vector of facet labels for the statistics facets, e.g. `paste(“Statistics:”,parameters)`. In PMXForest 1.2.6, `statisticsLabels`  should be a string that will be prepended to the `parameterLabels` (default is "Statistics:").  `parameterLabels` is by default is the same as `parameters`. Here are a few examples:

    forestPlot(dfres) 
Facet order: CL, Frel, AUC
Facet labels for the plot panels: CL, Frel, AUC
Facet labels for the statistics panels:  Statistics: CL, Statistics: Frel, Statistics: AUC 

    forestPlots(dfres,statisticsLabels=“Stat:”)
Facet order: CL, Frel, AUC
Facet labels for the plot panels: CL, Frel, AUC
Facet labels for the statistics panels:  Stat: CL, Stat: Frel, Stat: AUC 

    forestPlots(dfres,statisticsLabels=“Stat:”,parameters=c(“Frel”,”CL”),parameterLabels=c(“F”,”Clearance”))
(The order of parameterLabels must match the order of parameters.)
Facet order: Frel, CL
Facet labels for the plot panels: F, Clearance
Facet labels for the statistics panels:  Stat: F, Stat: Clearance
