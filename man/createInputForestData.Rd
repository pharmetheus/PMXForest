\title{Create Input Data Frame for a Forest Plot}
\usage{
createInputForestData(listCovs, iMiss = -99)
}
\arguments{
\item{listCovs}{A list where each element represents a covariate or a group
of covariates.
\itemize{
  \item For simple (univariate) effects, elements should be a named vector
    (e.g., `list(WT = c(70, 110))`).
  \item For grouped (multivariate) effects, elements should be a nested,
    named list of vectors (e.g., for a categorical variable `GENO`,
    `list(GENO = list(GENO_2 = c(0,1,0), GENO_3 = c(0,0,1)))`).
}}

\item{iMiss}{The numeric value that should be used to fill in columns that are
not applicable for a given row. Defaults to -99.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row represents a specific covariate value
  (or combination of values for grouped effects). The data frame contains a
  `COVARIATEGROUPS` column derived from the names in the input list, which is
  used to group effects in a forest plot.
}
\description{
This function transforms a specially formatted list of covariates
  and their values into a data frame suitable for generating a forest plot.
  It is designed to work with the output of the `getCovStats` function.
}
\examples{
# --- Example 1: Simple (Univariate) Covariates ---
# Each element in the list becomes its own group in the output data frame.
simple_covs <- list(
  SEX = c(0, 1),
  WT = c(70, 110)
)
df_simple <- createInputForestData(simple_covs)
print(df_simple)


# --- Example 2: Grouped (Multivariate) Covariates ---
# A nested list is used to group related effects. The outer list name ("GENO")
# becomes the value in the COVARIATEGROUPS column for all derived rows.
# This is the standard format for multi-level categorical variables.
grouped_covs <- list(
  GENO = list(
    GENO_2 = c(0, 1, 0), # Represents 3 levels, with level 1 as reference (0,0)
    GENO_3 = c(0, 0, 1)
  )
)
df_grouped <- createInputForestData(grouped_covs)
print(df_grouped)


# --- Example 3: Full Workflow with getCovStats ---
# The primary use case is to transform the output of getCovStats into a
# data frame ready for plotting.

# 1. Create sample data
sample_data <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  WT = c(60.5, 61.0, 70.2, 80.8, 65.1, 90.3),
  SEX = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0),
  RACE = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2)
)

# 2. Get covariate statistics using getCovStats. This creates a list
# containing both simple (WT, SEX) and nested (RACE) elements.
stats_list <- getCovStats(
  data = sample_data,
  covariates = c("WT", "SEX", "RACE"),
  minLevels = 4 # Ensure WT is continuous and RACE is categorical
)

# 3. Use the output from getCovStats to create the final data frame.
forest_plot_data <- createInputForestData(stats_list)
print(forest_plot_data)
}
