\usage{
getSamples(input, extFile = NULL, n = NULL, indexvec = NULL,
  zerosindex = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The input file name (character string).
bootstrap or SIR. If the file name extension is ".cov" it is assumed that the file
is a a NONMEM .cov file and if the extension is '.csv' is is assumed that it is a PsN raw results file from either a bootstrap or a SIR.}

\item{extFile}{The name of the NONMEM ext file. Needed to transform output to the ext-format.  Should not be NULL.}

\item{n}{The number of samples to generate. NULL is permissable if the input is a SIR raw_results file.}

\item{indexvec}{A vector that can be used to subset the columns in the raw results file so that the columns comes in the order THETA, SIGMA, OMEGA.
not required if a PsN raw_results_structure is present in the same directory as the csv file.}

\item{zerosindex}{A vector with indicies that indicates which parameters that are fixed to zero.}
}
\value{
A data frame with parameter vectors.

In case a .cov file is provided as input the parameter vectors is the result of multivariate sampling from the variance-covariance matrix.

In case a .csv file is provided as input and n=NULL, the input is assumed to be a SIR or bootstrap file. In case of a SIR file, all
samples present in the .csv file is returned. In case it is a bootstrap file, the function returns all samples with a nonzero value in the
ofv column.

In case a .csv file is provided as input and n is not NULL, it is assumed that the raw results come from a boostrap analysis. A variance-
covariance matrix will be created from the samples with a non-zero value in the ofv column and
n parameter vectors will be returned obtained by multivariate sampling from the constructed variance-covariance matrix.

\description{
Function that gets samples, either from a regular bootstrap (Psn output) a SIR (PsN output), a covariance matrix (NM output)
or samples from a small bootstrap using the estimated covariance matrix
