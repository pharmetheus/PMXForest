*** TODO - PMXForest (and possible FREM which are relevant for Forest plots)

* Print the table outside the plot in ggplot - Implement in plot function
* Log X axis - Implement in plot function  - Done
* Make it possible to change between median,mean,true - Implement in plot function and possible also in the calculation functions - Done
* Allow for a data frame in the sample function - Implement in sample function - Done
* Change the uncertainty properties of the reference - Implement in the calculation functions - Done
* Change the default name for the relative covariate effects - Implement in plot function - Done
* Allow to plot only a few covariates in the FREM model, i.e. not all covariates needs to be assigned in dfCovs - Implement in FREM calc function - Done
* Remove the code for the Y variable in the calculation function and add in plot function instead based on the GROUP variable - Done
