# PMXForest

The goal of PMXForest is to make it easy to create Forest plots for pharmacometric models, in particular NONMEM models. The user will only have to specify information about the covriate values to visualise, how the covariates relates to the parameters of interest and where the uncertainty information is. The latter can be a NONMEM .cov file, a PsN bootstrap or SIR raw_results file. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of PMXForest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pharmetheus/PMXForest")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(PMXForest)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
